# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the app

```bash
npx supabase start
npx supabase functions serve
npx expo start

adb reverse tcp:54321 tcp:54321
npx expo run:android

npx expo run:ios

# npx expo run:ios --device
# Change .env to EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://YOUR_LOCAL_IP_HERE:54321
# npx expo run:android --device
# cd ios/ && pod install --repo-update && cd ..
# npx expo prebuild --clean 
```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
